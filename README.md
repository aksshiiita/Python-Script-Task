Python-Script-Task

A minimalist python chatbot that learns to talk like a pro. 

This project is a minimalist, single-script Python chatbot developed to explore the capabilities of the Google Gemini API. It demonstrates core concepts of modern conversational AI, including persona definition and conversational memory management.

The chatbot maintains a strict, formal, and structured communication style, acting as a professional "Baby Chatbot" learning the ropes.
It utilizes a sequential data structure (Python list of dictionaries) to store and manage the complete chat history, enabling multi-turn conversations.

It includes robust try...except blocks to manage API errors and unexpected system interruptions gracefully.
